# DIAMOND PATTERN

Based on [EIP 2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)

From [Aavegotchi](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/diamond-standard) The diamond pattern is a contract that uses a fallback function to delegate function calls to multiple other contracts called facets. Conceptually a diamond can be thought of as a contract that gets its external functions from other contracts. A diamond has four standard functions (called the loupe) that report what functions and facets a diamond has. A diamond has a `DiamondCut` event that reports all functions/facets that are added/replaced/removed on a diamond, making upgrades on diamonds transparent.

The diamond pattern is a code implementation and organization strategy. The diamond pattern makes it possible to implement a lot of contract functionality that is compartmented into separate areas of functionality, but still using the same Ethereum address. The code is further simplified and saves gas because state variables are shared between facets.

Diamonds are not limited by the maximum contract size which is 24KB.

Facets can be deployed once and reused by any number of diamonds.

```solidity
bytes32 constant POSITION = keccak256(
     "some_string"
 );
 
 struct MyStruct {
     uint var1;
     uint var2;
 }
 
 function get_struct() internal pure returns(MyStruct storage ds) {
     bytes32 position = POSITION;
     assembly { ds_slot := position }
 }  
```

(The _slot suffix gives the storage address )

Trail of Bits Audit - Good idea, bad design

[https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/10/30/good-idea-bad-design-how-the-diamond-standard-falls-short/](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/10/30/good-idea-bad-design-how-the-diamond-standard-falls-short/) "The code is over-engineered, with lots of unnecessary complexities, and we can’t recommend it at this time."

But.. projects are using it For example [Aavegotchi](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/diamond-standard)

"AavegotchiDiamond provides a single Ethereum address for Aavegotchi functionality. All contract interaction with Aavegotchis is done with AavegotchiDiamond."

From Nick Mudge [article](https://dev.to/mudgen/ethereum-diamonds-solve-these-problems-3fmp) Diamonds solve these problems:

1. The maximum size a smart contract can be on Ethereum is 24kb. But sometimes larger smart contracts are needed or desired. Diamonds solve that problem.
2. Provides a structure to systematically and logically organize and extend larger smart contract systems so they don't turn into a spaghetti code mess.
3. Provides fine-grained upgrades. Other upgrade approaches require replacing functionality in bulk. With a diamond you can add, replace, or remove just the functionality that needs to be added, replaced or removed without affecting or touching other smart contract functionality.
4. Provides a single address for a lot of smart contract functionality. This makes integration with smart contracts and user interfaces and other software easier.

Question - How is this different to using a library ?

### Metamorphic Contracts

#### CREATE and CREATE2 and selfdestruct

CREATE gives the address that a contract will be deployed to

```solidity
keccak256(rlp.encode(deployingAddress, nonce))[12:]
```

CREATE2 introduced in Feb 2019

```solidity
keccak256(0xff + deployingAddr + salt + keccak256(bytecode))[12:]
```

Contracts can be deleted from the blockchain by calling selfdestruct.

selfdestruct sends all remaining Ether stored in the contract to a designated address.

This can be used to preserve the contract address among upgrades, but not its state. It relies on the contract calling selfdestruct then being re deployed via CREATE2

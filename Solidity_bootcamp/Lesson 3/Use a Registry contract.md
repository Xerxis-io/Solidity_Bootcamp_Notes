### Advantages
- Simple to implement
### Disadvantages
- We rely on the DApp code to choose the correct contract There is trust involved in the developers, not to switch out a contract with reasonable terms for an unfavorable one. "Keep in mind that users of your smart contract don’t trust you, and that’s why you wrote a smart contract in the first place."
- This doesn't solve the data migration problem

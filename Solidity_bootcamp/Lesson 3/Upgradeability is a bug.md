- Smart contracts are useful because they’re trustless.
- Immutability is a critical feature to achieve trustlessness.
- Upgradeability undermines a contract’s immutability.
- Therefore, upgradeability is a bug.
From the [Article](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/upgradeability-is-a-bug-dba0203152ce):
> We strongly advise against the use of these patterns for upgradable smart contracts. Both strategies have the potential for flaws, significantly increase complexity, and introduce bugs, and ultimately decrease trust in your smart contract. Strive for simple, immutable, and secure contracts rather than importing a significant amount of code to postpone feature and security issues.

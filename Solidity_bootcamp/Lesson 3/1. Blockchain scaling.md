"The decentralization of a system is determined by the ability of the weakest node in the network to verify the rules of the system." - Georgios Konstantopoulos

"**For a blockchain to be decentralized, it's crucially important for regular users to be able to run a node, and to have a culture where running nodes is a common activity**." - Vitalik [article](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html)

On Ethereum there is a goal to keep the hardware requirements low. There is a useful guide to scalability in their [documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/)

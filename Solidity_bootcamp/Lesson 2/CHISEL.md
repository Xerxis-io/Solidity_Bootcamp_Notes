**Chisel** is a Solidity REPL (short for "read-eval-print loop") that allows developers to write and test Solidity code snippets. It provides an interactive environment for writing and executing Solidity code, as well as a set of built-in commands for working with and debugging your code. This makes it a useful tool for quickly testing and experimenting with Solidity code without having to spin up a sandbox foundry test suite.
